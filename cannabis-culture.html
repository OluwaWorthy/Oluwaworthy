        <br>
        Recently, the 4.20PM Cannabis culture day was observed. 
        This was the 20th of April. I happened that day to be with a 
        few people that were celebrating this culture. One of them 
        wanted to have a conversation with me about it but I really 
        couldn’t partake because I realised that most of what I knew 
        about cannabis was hearsay, nothing solid. Not to mention 
        that I had been secondarily exposed to it for at least five 
        years now. 
        <br><br>
        This made me choose to research on it. Today, 
        we will be talking about Cannabis.
        How I got exposed to it
        The effects of Cannabis
        Medical uses of Cannabis
        Legality of Cannabis: Countries in which it is legal; 
        In what form it is legal; 
        <br>
        Cannabis is a psychoactive drug, it has two major components 
        that are responsible for most of its effects.
        First, THC which is Tetrahydrocannabinol while
        The second component that is interesting for Cannabis is CBD, 
        Cannabidiol
        <br><br><br>
        THC is the psychoactive component and CBD is the non-psychoactive component. 
        They both have several medical uses. 
        CBD, that’s Cannabidiol has been approved by the FDA in some states of the Unites States
        In Canada, it is approved in some drug form 
        In a few other countries, it is approved for medical use. Medical uses include
        Its potential in the treatment of Epilepsy
        Improves appetite for HIV/AIDS patients
        Antiemetic, in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy
        Treatment of neuropathic pain
        Treatment of rheumatoid Arthritis
        <br><br>
        Speaking with two doctors, they advised that <strong>common indicators of depression</strong> are; 
        Loss of interest in things one previously had interest in;
        Feeling hopeless;
        Constant moodiness;
        Constant tiredness;
        Inability to sleep;
        Weight loss or weight gain;
        Lack of appetite;
        Having suicidal thoughts.
        <br><br>
        THC on the other hand is the psychoactive component(Schizophrenia, Hallucinations, Psychosis) and it has not been approved for use in majority of countries. There are several risks in using it.
        These risks include
        Addiction/Dependence
        Withdrawal Syndrome
        Lowering of IQ
        Reduction in brain density of neural fibers - evidence from brain scans
        <br><br>
        However, there is a drug, that has a combination of 
        CBD and THC, it is approved for use in some countries
        <br><br>
        Politicians, activists, legislators are pushing for 
        cannabis legislation. This makes Cannabis of national 
        interest as people occupying certain public positions 
        or having influence are trying to make it legal. This 
        then raises the question and makes one ask, 
        Why are persons trying to make it legal?
        If its not medically considered comfortably safe, 
        why are there conversations to make it legal for 
        recreational use that is, for persons to 
        use it simply for fun.
        <br><br><br>
        <h6><strong> Misconceptions Associated With The Use of Cannabis</strong></h6> 
        Lets discuss the misconceptions that are associated with the use of cannabis
        It is non-addictive-No, it is addictive.It is addictive with withdrawal syndrome
        It improves lung activity-No, it does not improve lung activity. Possibly, this misconception arises from the medical fact that the use of cannabis causes widening of the bronchioles and because of this, maybe people think it improves the activity/functioning of the lung. Actually, in the long term what happens is that it reportedly is involved with chronic bronchitis.
        It is possible to smoke only cannabis-there are extreme circumstances where persons with very high discipline smoke only cannabis but investigative facts indicates that many persons that use cannabis started from using tobacco or other illicit drugs and then graduated into using cannabis. In other cases, persons that started using cannabis went ahead to use tobacco. Many Cannabis users mix cigarette and cannabis together. Other cannabis users went ahead to use even more damaging drugs. Cannabis is reportedly a gateway drug. Previously persons started with tobacco and went on to use cannabis. However, now, cannabis serves as a gateway to tobacco and other illicit drugs so, its a case of a reverse gateway drug situation.
        Last misconception is that it is of natural origin and that makes it safe-Who are we playing with? There are so many things which are of natural origin but are not safe.
        Ever heard of poisonous mushrooms?-Mushrooms that are entirely natural and one takes a bite then is dead? Shellfishes poisoned with algae and once eaten, one is paralysed. Shell fishes are of natural origin, algae are of natural origin. Several plants are of natural origin, not to mention cocaine being of natural origin, from the leaf of the coca plant(In only 2013, cocaine was responsible for 4300 deaths).
        -Something being natural doesn’t make it safe for consumption.
        <br><br>
        Why do persons seek out to use cannabis.
        For the europhoric effect it gives-A possible alternative would be watching comedic movies(jokes..worth a try though)
        For itss relaxing effect, the CBD component of cannabis gives a relaxing effect-possible alternative, read an entertaining book (jokes too.. surely worth the try though)
        It gives an energy boost-eat, take a smoothie shake, drink water-good energy right there.
        For creativity, inspiration, motivation-find what 
        you love…I’m just playing with you
        <br><br><br>
        <h6><strong> In what countries is cannabis legalised?</strong></h6>The Doctors advised,
        Within Europe, it is legalised in one form or another and generally for medical use
        In Canada, legalised for Medical use
        In most African countries, No it is not legalised for any kind of use. Ghana is an exception, a pharmaceutically purified form is legalised for medical use. In South Africa, it is legalised both for medical and recreational use
        In China, not legalised
        In Thailand, it is legalised in one form or the other.
        In Australia, for medical use
        <br><br><br>
        <h6><strong> Effects Of Cannabis</strong></h6>
        <strong>Short Term Effects of Cannabis.</strong>
        Immediately after smoking, there is intoxication, it affects behaviour, people might see things differently, they might loose consciousness, they might behave differently. Some persons might just be really excited. Some persons might might think differently, they might see small things as big. It basically influences the mind immediately, it intoxicates.
        Some persons might have panic attacks. Mostly, 
        this is for first time users. Some persons might hallucinate 
        from first time usage but not only from first time usage. 
        Some persons also hallucinate after regular usage. 
        Perhaps when they take a higher dose.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Long term Effects of Cannabis</strong> 
        Some persons get addicted, they depend on it.
        Some persons unfortunately develop a stroke from it.
        We mentioned acute bronchitis already.
        It influences the brain development, changes the brain structure after long term usage
        It reduces the density of neural fibers in some parts of the brain, it lowers the IQ
        It is associated with lower educational outcome, people achieve less educationally
        Lower life satisfaction
        It increases the risk of using other illicit drugs
        It impairs the memory, it impairs cognition
        It influences people’s ability to learn.
        <br><br>
        There is a 9% chance of addiction when one uses cannabis. 
        One may say that chance is low but the chance of dying 
        from corona virus is from below 1% to about 5%? It’s really 
        low. However, as at 2020, after less than a year of the 
        pandemic, the deaths recorded was already above 300,000. 
        This is only to say that because the chances of something 
        happening is low does not mean it doesnt happen. One may 
        not get addicted but why would one want to risk finding out. 
        Why would one want to risk disrupting one’s life if one 
        develops an addiction later on.
        Also, the idea of dependence on drugs to do basic things
        isn’t very cute. If it is a medical situation and it is 
        prescribed, that could work.
        One might argue that alcohol and tobacco are more 
        harmfuls than cannabis but are legal for recreational use.
